MSSE 680 – C# Software Development

Genealogy is designed to store family information in an effort to preserve valuable family details.  This project was created using Windows Form Application and consists of a simple authentication, adding family members, and listing family members that have been saved to the database.

Two SQL files have been included: “Create GenealogyDB.SQL” will create the appropriate tables for the database, and “PopulateGenealogyDB (1).SQL” will seed the database with login and family member information.  After running both SQL files and running the application, the default username and password will allow for a successful login
